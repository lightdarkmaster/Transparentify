# Transparentify
My simple python script for removing the background of an image using python.

Python packages used:
1. [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg)
2. [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)

## How to use the script
1. First create a 'image' folder where you can store the image you want to remove the background.
2. in the same directory create a python file removebg.py and copy the code.
3. install the above core packages.
4. create a outputImage folder.
5. run the code. (Be sure that the name of the image and directory is accurate.)
6. wait for the execution sometimes it will take a few seconds or more depending on the device used.
7. enjoy...
